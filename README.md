# DARC - Team K4toul4

This branch contains all my progress since the start of the project in September 2019 until 25 November 2019. 

## Scripts

Anonymization Script: 
./scripts/k4nU.py

Reidentification Script : 
./scripts/iK4n.py 

## Notebooks

If you want to get a deeper understanding of the clustering algorithm, you may refer to my (messy but very exhaustive) notes in :
./notebooks/KIP.ipynb

As this was my initial framework, I must specify that most of the methods presented in KIP were originally developped unther the following repository:
https://github.com/KIProtect/data-privacy-for-data-scientists

## Datasets 

First sets generated - Exploration Phase : 
./anonymized sets

For the rest, you will find most of our final sets in :
../master/competition
